# Smart Headlight Module
# Summary - 
As the prevalence of night-time driving continues to rise, ensuring driver safety has become
a critical concern. This research project delves into the escalating issue of intense low beam
headlights, examining their potential impact on driving safety and the increasing frequency
of car accidents. While high beams are subject to regulations and penalties, intense low beams,
often as bright as their high-beam counterparts, remain legal. This project aims to shed light
on the potential dangers associated with these headlights, which, although enhancing visibility
for the driver employing them, may pose a significant risk to other road users. This project
aims to focusing on the evolving technology of adaptive beam headlights. these cutting-edge
systems employ sophisticated camera technology to assess the road environment and the
positions of oncoming vehicles. Through real-time adjustments, these headlights modulate
brightness and beam shape, including a customizable "cut-off," to prevent blinding oncoming
drivers while effectively illuminating the remaining road space. The study explores the
multifaceted capabilities of adaptive beam headlights, investigating their continuous
adjustments in response to changing road conditions and the positions of other vehicles.
Hopefully with the help of adaptive headlights, we can reduce the temporary blinding of
drivers and reduce the number of road accidents.
